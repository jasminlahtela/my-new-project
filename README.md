Building AI course project
# AI-Driven Mental Health Companion
## Summary
This idea will give many people struglling with mental health support by AI-powered digital assistant that provides support through converstation. There AI works kinda like as psychologists or therapists. This system will basically offer emotional support, mindfullness exercises and help finding potentional mental health issues for its users. Mental health issues are a common wordwide problem and I think that this would offer a big help for many people, especially if they are not able to meet a professional. It is very important and I think it would affect a lot of people and hopefully help with recovering from mental illnesses or relieve them. 
## Data sources and AI techniques
This project depends on data such as text based converstations that can be found from the internet like different forums where can be found individuals own experiences. Also psychological research datasets with various mental health questionnaires and conversational patterns. This project also depends on AI techniques and those would be sentiment analysis to detect emotional states and tailor responses accordingly to them and machine learning classification to categorize conversations into potential mental health issues.
## How is it used?
This sytem is supposed to be used in mobile apps or websites. It should be easilly accessible and clear to use. I think it's important that the system is easly accessible so it can be low threshold help for people needing help. Users therefore would be individuals seeking mental health support who may not have access to traditional healthcare services and this system could be help for even professionals such as psychologist. 
## Challenges
Of course AI mental health support is not the same as talking with a professional or getting medical treatment but it can be also used as a supplemental tool. Also we have to be careful with privacy and data security which can lead to problems 
## What next?
This project could grow and be more if it was able to support in many different languages so it could be a help worldwidely. Also this sytem could be paired up with other devices such as smartwaches where the system could estimate physical symptons like sleep pattern and heart rate and maybe combine these informations with the treatment.
## Inspiration
I got inspiration from many mental health chatbots like Woebot and Wysa have inspired the vision for combining AI with mental health care and also readed a lot about this in the past.
